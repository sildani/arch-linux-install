My personal scripts for installing Arch Linux.

After getting into Arch Live CD, run the following commands:

1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sildani/arch-linux-install/master/01_install_arch.sh
1. sh ./01_install_arch.sh

The first script will download the other scripts and guide you along the way. Follow the prompts/cues, and you'll be up and running in your own install of Arch Linux.

This repo will be cloned into ~/arch_linux_install. I have lots of resources there if you're curious. If you're done exploring, feel free to remove - the active install does not depend on it.
